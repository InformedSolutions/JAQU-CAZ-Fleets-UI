        This service works by you telling us the number of days your vehicles drive in a Clean Air Zone.
        The number plates determine if the vehicles meet emissions standards in a zone.
        If they don't, you can see what the charges are and pay them.

        .govuk-inset-text
          You need to upload all your number plates before making a payment.
      - elsif @vehicles_count == 1
        .govuk-inset-text
          You need to add at least one more vehicle before making a payment.
